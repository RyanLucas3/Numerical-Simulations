# Numerical-Simulations

This repository contains code that I originally wrote in https://github.com/parleyyang/OPRG1. For the purposes of seperating it out from things I didn't write and since that other repository contains other less relevant things, this repository contains my code base for implementing a set of numerical simulations.

The code was written for this publication https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.11156.pdf, and closely matches the methodology you'll find in section 3 (simulations) of the paper.
